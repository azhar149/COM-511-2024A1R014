#Write a Python program to determine whether a student is eligible for a scholarship.
# The scholarship should be granted if the student satisfies either of the following conditions:
# a) The student has a CGPA of 8.5 or above and attendance of 85 percent or above.
# b) The student has won a national-level competition.
# The program should take CGPA, attendance percentage, and national-level competition status as input, then display whether the student is eleigible for the scholarship.

cgpa = float(input("Enter CGPA: "))
attendance = float(input("Enter attendance : "))
competition = input("Won national-level competition? (yes/no): ")

if (cgpa >= 8.5 and attendance >= 85) or competition.lower() == "yes":
    print("Student is eligible for the scholarship.")
else:
    print("Student is not eligible for the scholarship.")
